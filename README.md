# [Project 2: Profitable App Profiles for the App Store and Google Play Markets(JupyterNotebook)](https://github.com/khsarvar/Sarvar-Khamidov-portfolio/blob/main/JupyterProjects/Profitable_App.ipynb)
Our aim in this project is to find mobile app profiles that are profitable for the App Store and Google Play markets. We're working as data analysts for a company that builds Android and iOS mobile apps, and our job is to enable our team of developers to make data-driven decisions with respect to the kind of apps they build.

At our company, we only build apps that are free to download and install, and our main source of revenue consists of in-app ads. This means that our revenue for any given app is mostly influenced by the number of users that use our app. Our goal for this project is to analyze data to help our developers understand what kinds of apps are likely to attract more users.

# [Project 3: Stock Prediction(JupyterNotebook)](https://github.com/khsarvar/Sarvar-Khamidov-portfolio/blob/main/JupyterProjects/StockProject.ipynb)
Let's say we want to make money by buying stocks. Since we want to make money, we only want to buy stock on days when the price will go up (we're against shorting the stock). We'll create a machine learning algorithm to predict if the stock price will increase tomorrow. If the algorithm says that the price will increase, we'll buy stock. If the algorithm says that the price will go down, we won't do anything.

We want to maximize our true positives - days when the algorithm predicts that the price will go up, and it actually goes go up. Therefore, we'll be using precision as our error metric for our algorithm, which is true positives / (false positives + true positives). This will ensure that we minimize how much money we lose with false positives (days when we buy the stock, but the price actually goes down).

This means that we will have to accept a lot of false negatives - days when we predict that the price will go down, but it actually goes up. This is okay, since we'd rather minimize our potential losses than maximize our potential gains.

# [Project 4: VastChallenge(Tableau)](https://github.com/khsarvar/Sarvar-Khamidov-portfolio/tree/main/Tableau)
Mini-Challenge 2 uses a collection of spreadsheets and geospatial files to detail the activities of GASTech employees, including staff that are members of the Protectors of Kronos (POK) as they prepare for their daring kidnapping of GASTech employees. Hidden among the daily routines of regular employees are activities such as practicing the kidnapping route and monitoring   the targetsâ€™ homes to gather information. This dataset identifies the potential members of POK and their intended targets.
